# Introduction to Coding Workshop
 
 
 This class is for participants who have very little or no programming experience.

It’s the perfect time to learn to code! In this beginner-friendly class, we will learn the foundations of coding by creating fun interactive visuals, develop an intuition for navigating software, and learn to shape our creative expression to match with a computer’s expectations.

This is a hands-on, project-based class. By taking this class you will learn basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and take with you a bunch of code you wrote that can serve as a springboard to continue learning and creating. You’ll also have daily email support contact with the instructor while class is in session.

Participants should come to class with a laptop (PC, Mac or Linux) pre-installed with Google Chrome and Sublime Text (free software).
