## Approach

> Don't use any libraries, such as JQuery or p5.js. The students write everything from a blank HTML. The effect is that the students can hold in their heads the universe of code as they know it. Less lecture, more coding together. Code without shortcuts, code long-form, be like Maria Montessori, be on the students' level with them. Develop a vibrant landscape of visual metaphors. Convey as much vocabulary as possible.
