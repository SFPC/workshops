# Introduction to Coding Workshop

This class is a hands-on, minimum-dependency, cross-platform introduction to coding targeting beginners with no experience. All coding will be done inside .html files, learning HTML, CSS, and javascript. 

## Goals

* convey as many visual metaphors and vocabulary as possible
* learn only enough HTML and CSS to serve as a foundation for the more important subject: javascript
* as much class time as possible is spent coding together

> it's important to not use any libraries, such as JQuery or p5.js. Each exercise is from a blank .html, the students write everything. The effect is that the students can hold in their heads the universe of code as they know it.
