# YOU.JS Workshop
 
Make your own JavaScript library and become a fully self-actualized human being.
 

This two-day workshop explores the programming library as an expressive medium. You will learn how to make frontend/backend JavaScript libraries and command line tools to build and distribute your own subjectivity. At the end of the workshop you will upload your library to Node Package Manager (NPM) for online exhibition, so that anyone can access you and your functions from the command line.

Participants should be familiar with basic Javascript syntax (variables, functions) and have Node installed on their computers.
